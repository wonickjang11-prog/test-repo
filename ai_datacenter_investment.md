**Duration:** Multi-year investment cycle extending through 2030 and likely beyond.

**Constraints:** Power availability and cooling technology are the primary limiting factors, not capital availability.

**Distribution:** 60% computing hardware, 25% energy/cooling, 15% construction—a shift from traditional data center investment patterns.

**Geography:** U.S. and China dominating with 80% of growth, though Europe and emerging markets participating.

**Technology Evolution:** Rapid advancement in chip design, cooling systems, and power management necessary to achieve projected scale.

**Risk-Reward:** Unprecedented investment scale carries substantial execution and utilization risks, but AI market potential justifies continued commitment.

The institutions are aligned on the transformational nature of this investment cycle, though they differ on specific magnitude. The range of estimates reflects genuine uncertainty about AI adoption rates, technological efficiency improvements, and regulatory constraints rather than fundamentally different market views.

**Critical Success Factors:**
